## 📚 BCI Campus LMS – OOP Based System

This project is part of my university for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It simulates a simple Learning Management System (LMS) for BCI Campus, applying key OOP principles.

🔑 Features

# Student & Course Management

Create students and assign them to different courses (Degree, Diploma, Certificate).
Different average result calculation logic for each course type.

# Employee & Faculty Management

Create Academic and Non-Academic employees.
Salary calculation logic based on hourly rate or commission-based salary.

# Campus Information

Abstract Campus class implemented for flexibility.
Concrete implementation for BCICampus.

🛠️ Concepts Applied

✅ Encapsulation
✅ Inheritance
✅ Data Abstraction
✅ Abstract Cass Implementation
✅ Exception Handling & User Input

📂 File Structure

student.py → Student class
course.py → Course class

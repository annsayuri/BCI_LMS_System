# 📚 BCI Campus LMS – OOP Based System

This project is part of my university for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It simulates a simple Learning Management System (LMS) for BCI Campus, applying key OOP principles.

🔑 Features

## Student & Course Management

Create students and assign them to different courses (Degree, Diploma, Certificate).
Different average result calculation logic for each course type.

## Employee & Faculty Management

Create Academic and Non-Academic employees.
Salary calculation logic based on hourly rate or commission-based salary.

## Campus Information

Abstract Campus class implemented for flexibility.
Concrete implementation for BCICampus.

🛠️ Concepts Applied

✅ Encapsulation <br>
✅ Inheritance <br>
✅ Data Abstraction <br>
✅ Abstract Cass Implementation <br>
✅ Exception Handling & User Input <br>

📂 File Structure

student.py → Student class <br>
